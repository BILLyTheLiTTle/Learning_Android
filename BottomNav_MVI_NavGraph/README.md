# Navigation Graph & Bottom Navigation Bar & MVI & Data Binding

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to:
- Use Bottom Navigation Bar
- Fragments
- Navigation Graph
- LiveData
- Data Binding (one-way & two-way)
- Model-View-Intent design pattern
- Unit Testing
- Instrumented Testing

## Details
- Android 5 and above.
- See [how to getting started with MVI Archtecture on Android](https://proandroiddev.com/getting-started-with-mvi-architecture-on-android-b2c280b7023) for a very good description and a very good example. This article inspired me for this example.
- Articles about achieving MVI using [Uniflow](https://github.com/uniflow-kt/uniflow-kt/blob/master/Documentation.md):
