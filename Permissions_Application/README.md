## Disclaimer
- This [article](https://wajahatkarim.com/2018/11/multiple-runtime-permissions-in-android-without-any-third-party-libraries/) was very helpful during development this example.
It shows how to:
  - handle multiple permission in a kind of abstract way.
  - use rationale ("never ask again")
  - show the descriptive dialog
  - go to app settings to change permission state
  - keep track of the granted/denied permissions
