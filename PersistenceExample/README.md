# Persistence Example

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to use:
- Shared Preferences DataStore
- Protocol Buffer DataStore

### Sources
#### Shared PReferences DataStore
- The one and only [guide](https://proandroiddev.com/preference-datastore-the-generic-way-d26b11f1075f) you will need for SharedPref DataStore implementation.

#### Protocol Buffer DataStore
- From this [code snippet](https://github.com/zhaobozhen/LibChecker/blob/c0c3bc7c661fe45cc44d5c6ab0202764652e0b7e/app/build.gradle.kts#L197) you are going to need the `protobuf` section to put in the gradle kts file.
- From this [guide](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-proto-datastore) you are going to need the gradle file code (apart from the `protobuf` section), the *read/write* implementation and the *serializer*.
