# Gradle Example

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to:
- Insert libraries:
  - From local folder
  - From local repository
- Create a sample task to show the difference between configuration and execution phase
- Create a custom task to rename output file per flavor
- Modify the above custom task to a new plugin
- Create new tasks dynamically
- Run gradle tasks (dependsOn, mustRunAfter doLast, doFirst) and use attributes in command line (profiling)
- Gradle Android properties (split apk, manual shrinking)

## Details
This is just a clone of the [Hilt & MVVM & Data Binding & Clean Architecture & Reactive](Hilt_Example) example. I don't care about the code of the application because I want to focus on build file code.

## Issues
No issues at the moment.

## Disclaimer
- Nothing more than already described in the [Hilt & MVVM & Data Binding & Clean Architecture & Reactive](Hilt_Example) example.
