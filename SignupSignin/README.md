# Sign up / Sign in Example

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to use:
- Android Keystore
- Biometrics
- Encryption for persistence (Read and Save user password)

### Sources
- Should be added during development.

## Issues
To be added later.

## Disclaimer
For persistence purposes a simple class has been used which are not using Local Storage. I want to keep the example as simple as possible to demonstrate encryption.
