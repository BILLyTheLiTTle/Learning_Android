# Sign up / Sign in Example

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to use:
- Android Keystore
- Biometrics
- Encryption for persistence (Read and Save user password)

### Sources
- Although this project is more complete, this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50447410/1392366) is a great start and it helps you understand what you are trying to achive and how to do it.

## Issues
To be added later.

## Disclaimer
For persistence(!) purposes a simple class has been used which is not using Local Storage. I want to keep the example as simple as possible to demonstrate encryption.
